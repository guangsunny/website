The purpose of this project was to design, fabricate and test a novel transducer and inspection technique for detecting cracks near fastener sites in aircrafts with high efficiency and sensitivity.

* Finite element model including matlab user interface was developed to simulate and design sensors & probes 
* Testing system including data acquisition and signal processing 
* Simulation investigations on frequency, waveform shape, harmonics, sensitivity and circuit design
